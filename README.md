# Loan Approval Prediction
Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that every retail bank faces in their lending operations. If the loan approval process is automated, it can save a lot of man hours and improve the speed of service to the customers. The increase in customer satisfaction and savings in operational costs are significant. However, the benefits can only be reaped if the bank has a robust model to accurately predict which customer's loan it should approve and which to reject, in order to minimize the risk of loan default.
